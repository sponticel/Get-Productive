## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths:
I ahve a clear picture of what my app should look like. After project 1 i know how to better get started which was my issue for the first project. I also know what lessons to refrences and what subjects I am weak in so I can focus on that early on.
### Weaknesses:
I dont completely understand CRUD and I normally get stuck when setting up my forms on labs so I know I will struggle with this. luckliy because I struggle here I know what i need to refrence to help me.
### Opportunities:
I am able to strengthen the areas where I know I struggle based on past homeworks and labs.
### Threats:
I have a hard time moving on to something else or knowing when I need to ask for help. I usually will continue with the for for hours before realizing that I need to approach the issue in a different way, and its a waste of time. I am aware of this this time arround and will have it in mind when I have an issue.
